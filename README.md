# Jeremy Stevens Sample Portfolio

## Description

This purpose of this project is to create a sample portfolio website for Challenge 02 for the GA Tech Coding Bootcamp. This website is deisgned to demonstrate my ability to structure a website using CSS properties. This webpage showcases the flexbox model and pseudo class selectors to improve the user experience. As an essential feature of flexbox functionality, the content scales according to the users screen size. Additionally, when the user hovers over elements within the 'work' section, feedback is given via a change in pointer style and shadows around the boxes. The navigation links at the top of the screen take the user to the specified section of the webpage, and the links attached to the images and footer take the user to my github page.
